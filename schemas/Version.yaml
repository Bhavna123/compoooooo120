title: Version
description: |-
  Represents the API document for a specific version of an API which used for reference by application developers. A version document is also known as an API specification. Each API enhancement requires a new version to be published in the catalog which includes an incremented minor version number, along with descriptions and examples for the functional changes.

  Each newer version in the same series must be backwardly compatable, ie. non-breaking for consuming applications.
